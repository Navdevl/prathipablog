  Hi all!


  Here I am back with a book review. I still have a few books from this year
  that I haven’t reviewed yet. Since I’m in Delhi for another three days, just
  enjoying some 'The Eagles' music alone in my room and diving into my next
  reads, I figured it’s the perfect time to write a review. This particular book
  felt like it needed to be reviewed now. People often think I’m not fun enough
  to read fiction, so here’s a fiction review for you. And of course, it turned
  out to be quite deep, well Haruki Murakami has that effect!

# **A Journey of Self-Discovery: Revisiting Fiction**

#### *Hi all!*

*Here I am back with a book review. I still have a few books from this year that I haven’t reviewed yet. Since I’m in Delhi for another three days, just enjoying some 'The Eagles' music alone in my room and diving into my next reads, I figured it’s the perfect time to write a review. This particular book felt like it needed to be reviewed now. People often think I’m not fun enough to read fiction, so here’s a fiction review for you. And of course, it turned out to be quite deep, well Haruki Murakami has that effect!*

### **From Fiction to Philosophy: My Reading Evolution**

Well, as a young reader, I started with fiction like everyone else, indulging in daydreams and imaginative worlds. Over time, my focus shifted to non-fiction and philosophical works, reflecting my evolving priorities. Yet, as a passionate writer and daydreamer, I still enjoy fiction. A few months ago, I picked up Haruki Murakami’s Kafka on the Shore, which turned out to be quite deep.

I spent a leisurely weekend a few months ago taking a bike ride to Mahab Beach, where I watched the old Tamil film Mozhi and read Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami. The novel is a rich, layered story that mixes magical realism, psychological drama, and philosophical ideas. It follows two separate storylines that eventually come together in interesting ways.

### Plot Overview: Kafka Tamura’s Journey

In this book, the story follows a 15-year-old runaway named Kafka Tamura, who flees Tokyo to escape a family curse foretold by his clairvoyant father. This curse predicts that Kafka will kill his father and commit incest. The intertwined stories of Kafka and Nakata unveil profound truths about their identities and destinies, culminating in a resolution that invites multiple interpretations.

### Personal Reflections: Resonance with My Own Journey

I found myself reflecting deeply on my own journey of self-discovery and the quest for survival. The novel follows Kafka, who sets out to redefine himself, a quest that resonates with my own navigation through uncertainty and self-doubt. Kafka's struggles with insecurity and fear echo my own concerns about whether I can truly make it on my own.

### Favorite Quotes: Insights from the Book

> One of my favorite quotes from the book is: “And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”

### Nakata’s Quest: A Parallel Journey

At the same time, an older man named Nakata, who possesses the unique ability to communicate with cats, embarks on a search for a missing cat and becomes entangled with Johnnie Walker. Nakata's quest intersects with Kafka's.

### Kafka’s Refuge: The Mystical Guesthouse

Upon arriving in Takamatsu, Kafka takes refuge in a guesthouse run by the mysterious Miss Saeki and her assistant, Hoshino. There, Kafka experiences a range of strange phenomena, including encounters with a talking crow and the power to alter reality through his dreams and thoughts. His journey also involves a peculiar meeting with a young woman named Sakura, who may or may not be connected to his sister.

### Nakata’s Search: The Enigmatic Johnnie Walker

Nakata, an older man with cognitive impairments, is on a mission to find a lost cat named Goma. His search leads him through various odd jobs and an encounter with the enigmatic Johnnie Walker, a sinister spirit who collects cat souls. Nakata's confrontation with Johnnie Walker results in a supernatural battle, leaving Nakata with feelings of confusion and loss.

### Intersecting Paths: Nakata and Hoshino’s Journey

Nakata's journey intersects with Hoshino, a truck driver who becomes a crucial ally in Nakata’s search for the missing cat. Together, they navigate a series of bizarre and mystical events that shed light on Nakata’s unique abilities and his role in the larger scheme of things.

As Nakata delves deeper into his journey, he gains a greater understanding of his own nature and the cosmic forces influencing his life. His connection with Kafka and his quest for answers become increasingly intertwined as they both grapple with the mysterious and metaphysical aspects of their existence.

Throughout the novel, it becomes evident that Kafka and Nakata's stories are connected in both literal and symbolic ways. Kafka’s struggle with his identity and Nakata’s quest for understanding converge in a climactic moment, revealing profound truths about their intertwined destinies. The novel concludes with many questions remaining open to interpretation, exploring themes of memory, identity, and the nature of reality.

### Personal Resonance: Finding Connection and Confidence

The novel creates a world where the line between reality and imagination is fluid, examining the effects of past traumas and the quest for personal meaning in a seemingly chaotic universe. The interwoven stories of Kafka and Nakata, combined with the novel's rich symbolism and enigmatic characters, make it a captivating and thought-provoking read. It encourages readers to reflect on the nature of existence and the deeper connections between individuals and their inner selves.

Kafka’s struggle to escape his past and find his identity resonates with my own desire to prove my independence and overcome self-doubt. I find parallels between his fear of an inescapable storm and my own anxieties about facing the unknown. The novel’s blend of the surreal and the real captures the disorientation and mixed emotions that accompany the journey of forging a new path. I find its themes profoundly resonant with my own journey of self-discovery and survival.

### Other favorite quotes from the book:

* In everybody’s life there’s a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can’t go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That’s how we survive.
* Taking crazy things seriously is a serious waste of time.” (and you know what life is crazy, and my mentor always says don’t take anything in life seriously, so yeah..)
* Everyone of us is losing something precious to us. Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, and feelings we can never get back again. That’s part of what it means to be alive.”
