# The Challenge of Starting Over

Moving to a New City and Finding Comfort in Unexpected Places

Leaving home and moving to a new city has been one of the most challenging phases of my life. Navigating unfamiliar surroundings and struggling with long-distance relationships personally, and relationships here at work, left me feeling isolated. In the midst of this turmoil, Mitch Albom’s books, Tuesdays with Morrie and Have a Little Faith, offered a much-needed sense of comfort and perspective.

Though Have a Little Faith is undeniably rooted in religious themes, it resonated with me during a time when I was grappling with loneliness and searching for solace. It reminded me to seek faith, whether in God, in people, or even in myself. Over the past month, as I experienced ups and downs, I began to understand life and relationships in a way that mirrored the teachings of these books from the Mentors of Mitch Albom, and the wisdom imparted by my own mentor in 2022, someone who became my “Morrie.”

# The Power of Mentorship: Finding My Morrie

How Mitch Albom’s Books Resonate with My Own Experiences

> “We read through his old sermons and discussed their relevance. I found I could share almost anything with Reb. He had a way of looking you in the eye and making you feel as though the world had stopped and you were all that mattered. Maybe this was his gift to the job. Or maybe it was the job’s gift to him.” - Quote from Have a Little Faith. 

I’ve often wondered if my mentor’s compassion comes from being a pediatrician or if she had a soft spot for me specifically. At one point, I even asked her. She simply replied, “We don’t always know why we do what we do for someone, it’s the universe’s call.” That’s why I deeply believe in the power of the universe, the kindness it inspires, and the wisdom of my mentor.  

As I read Tuesdays with Morrie and Have a Little Faith, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of jealousy over Mitch and Morrie’s unique bond. But more than that, I kept thinking of my mentor, the one person who has been my constant source of guidance and inspiration. I never set out to read books on mentorship, but Tuesdays with Morrie came to me randomly during a visit to the Museo Camera event with Cankids. It was in the Honor Library there, and I couldn’t resist buying it for myself after starting to read it. Ever since I arrived here, it’s felt like I carried her mentorship with me, it’s one of the things that keeps me going.  

Much like Mitch is grateful for his time with Morrie and his moments with the Reb, I will always be grateful for the moments I’ve shared with her. Whether it was sitting together in the OPD, asking to speak with her privately and walking her to her car, or showing up at her home unannounced and finding her making time for me, even on a busy Sunday morning - it all meant the world to me. These memories are countless, and I could go on and on. Her support has been invaluable, and I am forever thankful for her presence in my life.

# Learning from Life's Struggles

Finding Peace Amid Misunderstandings and Personal Growth

Life hasn’t been easy lately. Misunderstandings with family and struggles at work weighed heavily on me, especially because I felt I wasn’t in the wrong. I kept voicing my frustrations, only for the right causes though, but still, they didn’t bring peace or resolution. As I was reading these books, and especially today particularly during my vulnerable moment as I am feeling terribly sick with my on-going mental exhaustion, I found myself reevaluating my perspective. Morrie’s lessons on forgiveness and letting go deeply impacted me. If Morrie could forgive and release his burdens, why couldn’t I? I decided to make peace with those around me, choosing love and understanding over lingering resentment. 

Even though I was feeling sick last weekend and going through an emotional roller coaster, I still went Christmas shopping for my family and picked up some home essentials. There were moments when my ego wanted to take over, and I thought about letting go, but then I reminded myself what if that next year, I might not be able to celebrate Christmas at home. The thought of "what if?" echoed in my mind. Life is so short, and nothing is permanent. It was a wake-up call for me, reminding me of a conversation between Mitch and Morrie, where they discussed what Morrie would do if he had 24 healthy hours to live.

Before my transfer, I had so many plans, spending time with friends and family, going on one-day bike trips, but right before I left, I fell ill with an unknown fever. I had never been this sick all year, but it hit me just before I was about to leave. I ended up getting admitted to the hospital for a week. And that’s life, isn’t it?

> “What if you had one day, perfectly healthy?” I asked myself.“What would you do?”“Twenty-four hours?” Morrie replied.“Twenty-four hours.”“Well, let’s see. I’d get up in the morning, do my exercises, have a lovely breakfast with sweet rolls and tea, go for a swim, and then invite my friends over for a nice lunch. I’d have them come one or two at a time so we could talk about their families, their struggles, and remind each other of how much we mean to one another. Then I’d take a walk in a garden with trees, enjoy the colors, watch the birds, and take in the nature I’ve missed for so long. In the evening, we’d all go to a restaurant for some great pasta—maybe some duck, I love duck—and then we’d dance the night away. I’d dance with all the wonderful partners until I was exhausted. Then, I’d go home and have a deep, peaceful sleep.”It seemed so simple, so ordinary. I expected him to mention something extravagant, like flying to Italy or having lunch with the President. After months of being unable to move, how could he find perfection in such a simple day?

But then it hit me, that was the point. The beauty and fulfillment Morrie found in the simplest moments, in connecting with others, and in appreciating the life he had left. It made me rethink everything.

I even left messages to a few of them today, well not everyone was ready to accept the peace, but it is okay, I reminded myself to breathe.

# The Healing Power of Forgiveness

Applying Morrie's Lessons to My Own Life

If you have known me as a writer for the past ten years, or even as an individual, you know I’m big on love and kindness. Most of my writing revolves around these principles, which also form the core of my life philosophy: LOVE. This conviction makes Morrie’s words resonate even more:

> “It’s not just other people we need to forgive, Mitch,” he finally whispered. “We also need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn’t do. All the things we should have done. You can’t get stuck on the regrets of what should have happened. That doesn’t help you when you get to where I am.”

As someone who constantly criticizes myself, this was a revelation. Even today, I am having a hard time forgiving myself for taking time off work being terribly sick, knowing I’ll soon need additional personal leave. Despite reading Morrie’s wisdom, I’m still learning how to implement it in my life. It is easier said than done, isn’t it, haha. 

# The Role of Relationships in Our Lives

Why We Need Others to Thrive

Mitch Albom’s writing has solidified his place as one of my favorite authors. Both Tuesdays with Morrie and Have a Little Faith are true stories that draw from Albom’s personal life. The authenticity of these narratives makes them even more poignant and relatable.

Tuesdays with Morrie recounts Albom’s relationship with his college professor, Morrie Schwartz, who becomes his mentor and source of endless wisdom. They reconnect years later when Morrie is diagnosed with ALS, and their subsequent conversations tackle profound topics like death, family, emotions, and forgiveness.

Morrie’s ability to face his mortality with grace and love is both heartbreaking and inspiring. One of my favorite quotes is when Morrie says:

> “Dying is only one thing to be sad over, Mitch. Living unhappily is something else.”

This struck a chord with me because so many of us, as Morrie says, live within a culture that teaches us the wrong things. Morrie’s advice to “create your own culture” is both simple and powerful. For me, this was a reminder to live authentically, despite the misunderstandings and struggles that weigh me down. Ever since my transfer here, I’ve spent much of my time here feeling unhappy, whether it was conflicts with colleagues or misunderstandings with my family due to the distance. These tensions have been weighing on me, slowly eating away at my peace. With my health now failing as well, I reached my breaking point. It was during this time that Mitch Albom and his mentors became my refuge, offering the comfort and wisdom I desperately needed.

# Faith and Action: What I Learned from Have a Little Faith

Faith as an Act of Integrity and Love

Apart from the long-distance relationship weighing on me already, work here, too, has its challenges. There’s already so much drama in the world, why carry it into our daily lives? Since we spend a significant portion of our time with colleagues, I’ve realized the value of striving for harmony. I may not embody all of Morrie’s or the Rabbi’s principles, but I’ve decided to live more in the present, appreciating those around me and spreading love wherever I can.

Yes, work hasn’t always been easy ever since I got my transfer here, but there have been moments and people who brought me comfort. Dr. Neelima and I faced a challenge together, and we both took responsibility for each other. I truly admired the way she handled it, it meant a lot to me.  

I also can’t thank Kevin enough for his kindness since Day 1. I genuinely enjoy working with him and secretly hope to "borrow" a little from his network, haha!

And Soumya Sir, though I’ve never seen you, didn’t know what you looked like, and only recently heard your voice, thank you for standing up for me, supporting the right causes, and sharing your “Gyaan”. It means a lot! 

> "Be compassionate," Morrie whispered. "And take responsibility for each other. If we only learned those lessons, this world would be such a better place."   He paused, took a breath, and then added his mantra: "Love each other or die."

# Quiet Connections, Lasting Impact

Reflections on My Journey and the Importance of Being Present

Another favorite moment was Morrie’s reflection on relationships:

> “In the beginning of life, when we are infants, we need others to survive, right? And at the end of life, when you get like me, you need others to survive, right? But here’s the secret: in between, we need others as well.”

This wisdom, coupled with his call to “invest in the human family,” reminded me of the importance of valuing connections over material pursuits. Sometimes, I get so frustrated that I want to run away and be alone. But, as Morrie teaches, even amidst conflict, we need relationships to survive and thrive.

# A Future Filled with Love and Writing

My Aspiration to Share My Story through Writing

In Have a Little Faith, Mitch Albom takes readers on a journey exploring faith, forgiveness, and redemption through the lives of two men, a Jewish rabbi and a Christian pastor. The Reb’s unwavering commitment to his rituals and selfless service deeply inspired me. One quote that struck me was, “Faith is about doing. You are how you act, not just how you believe.” It reminded me to live with integrity and kindness, to be a person of action rather than just words. In that sense, I’m proud of the person I strive to be.  

I had a thought-provoking conversation with a junior colleague who is deeply rooted in faith and religion. It was during one of my final afternoons at the BMT Unit before moving. We debated the concept of God, and I shared my perspective: I don’t believe in “God” as a figure but rather in the divine within people. Like how patients see doctors as gods, it’s about how you act. That, to me, is faith. That is God, the person you choose to be!

The book’s reflections on enduring love also resonated with me, especially this line: “That kind of love - the kind you realize you already have by the life you’ve created together - that’s the kind that lasts.” It made me reflect on relationships that, despite hardships, remain strong through cooperation and selflessness. For me, it’s never been easy, but I’m learning to make peace, one step at a time.  

At its core, Have a Little Faith emphasizes that the journey to belief, whether in God, in others, or in ourselves, is rarely straightforward, easy, or logical. One quote beautifully captures this sentiment: “When you come to the end, that’s where God begins.” When I first arrived here, I hit my emotional threshold so many times. At one point, I couldn't even afford my therapy, nor could I reach out to people who once felt like my support system. In those moments, I found myself crying out, “God!” And perhaps, in that vulnerability, that faith comforted me! In those moments, these books became my sanctuary.

Mitch Albom’s ability to weave deeply personal and spiritual themes into universally relatable narratives is remarkable. While reading these books, I felt a renewed sense of purpose, to forgive, to love, and to cherish the present. His storytelling reminded me that the power of faith lies not just in religion, but in the connections we build with one another. It is definitely not easy, but it can be done. 

I recently had a conversation with one of my former supervisors, and we talked about how challenging things have been for me here. I mentioned how, even though I don’t speak with everyone, my absence, even for a single day, gets noticed. He shared something that stayed with me. He said, “Even though you were quiet and reserved, I remember during your first meeting at the office, everyone was casually talking to you. When I asked others, ‘That girl doesn’t even speak much—how do you all know her so well?’ they said, ‘She’s a nice kid. She talks to us at the hospital and always gets things done.’ Your presence was felt and known, in a very genuine and loving way.”  

That really struck a chord with me. It made me realize the connections I had built there, even in my quiet way. I truly felt that during my farewell. People from the hospital, even from two different ones I had worked with, and those from my organization all came together to send me off with such warmth and kindness. It was a moment I’ll always hold close to my heart. 

> "As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.""Death ends a life, not a relationship."

As I finished reading this book during a challenging phase in my life, all these memories came flooding back, and it made me truly appreciate the beauty of human connection. It’s not always sunshine and rainbows, but we can always keep trying.

# Closing Thoughts

The Lasting Wisdom of Mitch Albom’s Works and Their Impact on My Life

Both books are masterpieces, and I feel fortunate to have read them at a time when I needed their wisdom the most. Mitch Albom’s works through his personal life are a testament to the beauty of human connection, the importance of forgiveness, and the enduring impact of love.

I’ve always written from personal experiences, and while I’ve faced criticism for sharing so much, I’ve also received an overwhelming amount of love over the past year. Hearing from juniors and random younger versions of myself about how my raw stories helped them has made it all worth it. After reading Mitch Albom, I’m even more certain of the kind of writer I want to be. So, who knows? Maybe you’ll see a book from me soon! Finishing the draft of my book is definitely on my 2025 bucket list! 

If you've made it to the end, send me all your best wishes for my upcoming book! I’ll know if you've read the full review, haha!
