## A Flood of Memories in Bangalore

Hello everyone,

I'm in Bangalore this weekend to visit my newlywed Anna and Anni! Being back in this city brings back a flood of memories.

I want to share a post about gratitude, self-appreciation, and self-awareness. I'll try to keep it short.

The last time I had an extended stay here was in November 2023, when I took a month-long break from work for personal health reasons. Since then, I've visited Bangalore several times, but not for leisure.

Reflecting on the past six months since November, I realize how far I've come. While I wouldn't say I'm in a better place now, life is never easy for anyone, right? Everyone faces their own difficulties. Specifically, what I went through last year had been ongoing since 2017, as I've seen in my writings and sketches from that time. When I used to draw or write about those experiences back then, people, even my siblings, found them inspiring or deep, not realizing I was actually going through those struggles. But if I were to create similar pieces now, they would be at my doorstep right away. That's how much my life has changed.


## Navigating Health Challenges

I've been writing very bluntly without providing context. I've never really wanted to get a formal diagnosis in terms of my mental health, even though I do seek professional help. I believe it's an individual's choice. While I'm very open about mental health and have been advocating for it since 2017, I personally choose not to seek a diagnosis. Only because the medications I take reveals certain diagnosis, but my physicians and psychologists asked me in the beginning if I wanted to know or properly discuss the diagnosis, and I said no. I've been working on myself from there, and that's okay. It's not about fearing labels or stereotypes; I just didn't want to know. We use terms like feeling overwhelmed, wanting to stay grounded, and crowded thoughts, and I'm fine with that.

Besides mental health, looking back at my writings since 2017, along with my mental health, I often wrote about my physical suffering. I've been in constant pain for years. I can't remember the last time I slept peacefully. I wrote a piece about anxiety in 2018 where I described feeling like my bones were disintegrating from my body. I've written about my back pain, palpitations, shivering, and tremors, from 2017 to today. I usually seek professional help every other year but then get tired of it, both mentally and financially. This has been my pattern. However, I've never sought proper consultation in the past years. I would get fluids every few months because I feel weak or see a random doctor and then wouldn't follow up because I have trust issues.This year, thanks to a special someone, I've found good professional help for my mental health. I'm also trying to seek proper consultation for my physical health. There hasn't been a day in the last year where I've been without a headache. Again, I didn't want to be diagnosed for that, but thanks to that someone, in the past month, there have been a few weeks where I've felt what it's like to be without a headache and eye pain. While I don't have a serious illness, visiting random doctors for this pain without any relief has been exhausting and made me lose hope. But these medications have worked like a miracle for me. At one point, I got addicted to all kinds of painkillers, and none worked for me. Seeking a proper diagnosis has helped me with my headaches and mental health so far. Mental health is a long journey, but as long as I have a supportive circle to turn to, I've got this.

As for my general health, I'm still figuring it out. At this point, all my specialist physicians sometimes attribute my symptoms to my mental health diagnosis, saying that mental health has serious effects on the gut, muscles, and so on, and that should be addressed first.

On the other hand, you wouldn't believe how the lack of all your vitamins in your body can make you feel so weak. I don't know if this is the cause, but all my vitamin levels have been extremely low, which at least makes sense regarding my extreme fatigue and excruciating joint, muscle, and bone pains. I'm still getting consultations and figuring out what is exactly wrong with me. I've given myself a deadline for this month for my general health. For once, I want to listen to my body, but dealing with it alone has been hard. Sometimes, to protect the smiles of your loved ones, you just want to wear a mask, and it's hard on you as well. But yeah, I'm giving myself a deadline to figure out what's wrong by seeking professional help. 

## Gratitude for Supportive Relationships

The other day, when I was experiencing excruciating pain in my joints and bones and reading my writings from past years, I felt miserable. I was alone at home and started crying uncontrollably. I tried calling around five people, two friends from out of state, my boyfriend and others from here, but I hesitated because when you're feeling miserable, you don't want to disturb others, yet you still want help. None of them picked up or called back. I also messaged my newly-wed brother, but he was held up, and my sister was with our mother, so I decided not to call her. My final option was to reach out to my support circle from my current workplace. I knew she was on leave that day and out with her family, but I still tried calling. I just rang twice and hung up, and after 2 seconds, she called back. She's like an elder sister to me, and I feel comfortable sharing with her because she doesn't pressure me to open up; she just listens. During our call, we started talking randomly about her day, and after about 10 minutes, she sensed something was wrong and asked me to share. I started crying and told her about my physical pain. This is what I appreciate about the universe, it always provides you with good people wherever you go. You will always be surrounded by someone, no matter what.

There was another time when I was having a mental breakdown, and I desperately wanted to call my mentor, but I felt it would be inappropriate since it was late, around 10 pm. I rang once and hung up. To my surprise, she called back. I cried during that call as well. 

There have been many moments with my boyfriend where I've asked him to come over randomly just so I could cry. I felt unable to cry at home because I have to maintain a facade of being happy and healthy. Even during our break and trip, 70% of the time was spent in venting and crying sessions with him. I'm glad he still puts up with me.
I'm grateful to have people in my life who are healing things they didn't break.

## A New Sense of Confidence

Even though I wanted to keep this post short, it has once again become lengthy. But what I want to say is, listen to your body, both physically and mentally, no matter what others say. I know it's tiring. Seek proper professional help from the beginning, unlike me. It took me years, and I'm still on the verge of giving up in terms of my physical health because every physician ultimately attributes my symptoms to my mental health. But as long as my body goes, I'm going to keep going.

In less than five months, I'll be hitting my silver jubilee, and I don't want to pity myself anymore. I've been doing well. I don't want to feel insecure anymore. I don't want to dwell in the past. I've lived for everyone else; now it's time to look out for myself for once.

I've always had insecurities about my skills, despite being a topper throughout my schooling and college and winning competitions and awards for speech and writing. Every time I make a presentation, post a write-up, or even send an email, I feel very insecure and lack confidence. However, recently, I got the opportunity to work on a research proposal and with my amazing mentor and be as the Co- Principal Investigator. Under her guidance, I wrote the proposal, but even when I sent it to her, I texted her saying I wasn't confident and would work on any corrections she suggested. We submitted the proposal, and on the presentation day, my mentor couldn't be there. As the Co-Principal Investigator, I had to present, even though everyone else was a medical professional and I'm not, and way more older than I am. I did it and even answered queries surprisingly well. However, I felt guilty, thinking my mentor would have done a better job, when the results took a long time to come. However, when I found out that our research had been selected, I was thrilled.

But it didn't stop there. We had to get ethical committee approval in our hospital. My mentor was out of the country and initially asked me to present, which scared me. But then she said we would do it after she came back. This month was the presentation, and two days before, she texted me in the morning, and I thought she asked me to come early just to review the PowerPoint and that she would present. To my shock, she jokingly said I would present and that she would answer any queries. I wasn't prepared. I usually prepare at home and come for any presentation, but this time, I was totally unaware. I'm an anxious person, which she knows well, and I'm very aware of it. But I had no option, so I quickly altered the PowerPoint and went through it before going to the meeting place. 

However, by the time I went to the meeting place, the meeting had already started, but we were the second ones to present. Now we have to wait. But the delay was perhaps for the good. Before my mentor arrived, I sat through around 40 presentations, of which the ethical committee representative appreciated about 5-6 proposals for their proposal writing style. When our turn came, ours was also appreciated, maybe this is why I had to sit through those 40 presentations. Maybe for me to hear, out of over 40 presentations, ours was one of the 6-7 presentations that received appreciation for the written proposal. We were given suggestions and corrections, but I had the confidence to present once again among medical professionals, despite being this teeny-tiny non-medical person.

I have a long journey ahead of me, and instead of dwelling in self-pity or repeatedly cleaning up the past mess, I need to focus on moving forward. I used to believe that I hadn't connected much with patients or caregivers. However, over the past few months, when they came looking for me, calling me "Prathipa akka"or "Prathipa athai, or “Prathipa Madam" it warms my heart. In social work, we learn about the stages of interacting with patients, with the final stage being termination, followed by follow-up. I am still learning how to be a professional in this field. Despite thinking that I hadn't connected with patients and caregivers here, it has been a year and a half, which is actually quite a long time. I have built a good rapport, and it makes me feel that I am doing a pretty decent job. I am still learning to work on termination and how to cope with working around grief and palliation. But knowingly or unknowingly, I have made someone feel better. I thought I wasn't doing that part, but last month, I realized that I am working on that part as well. It is time for me to create something of my own now. It is time for me to do what I always wanted to do, to keep making others smile as much as I can, to advocate for others in terms of psycho-social aspects of health and mental health as much as possible, to publish something of my own. It is time for me to live my life to the fullest and spread love and kindness!

All of this made me feel like life has given me a brand new lease on life, like the song I've been listening to by Andy Grammer. Thank you, Ma'am. You really are more than a mentor to me in the past one and a half years of my professional and personal journey!

## Embracing Vulnerability: Reflections on Support and Self-Care 

Yesterday, we went to Ikea, and there was this saying: "You can do it yourself, but you don't have to."

In the past few months, when I went to my hospital appointments alone, there were days when I felt like I had someone by my side. I used to think my veins were so visible and it would be easier to insert an IV, but I learned in these visits that it was all a lie. There are times when the nurses in the ER have to make multiple attempts to insert a line, and I would be in tears, wishing for someone I knew to hold my hand. But it was all worth it to see the smiles on the faces of the people I care about.

This time, I'm here in Bangalore for a break only, but my body completely failed me. My elder sister used to look weaker than me, but she had more stamina than me throughout the day and enjoyed herself. I almost cried when my legs started shaking, and I felt nauseated and lightheaded. I went to the car and waited.

So, please listen to your body. Seek professional help as early as possible when your body and mind give you hints. It's okay if you want to do things yourself, but just remember, you don't have to.

Thanks to Bangalore, I have a love-hate relationship with this city, I suppose. And thanks to my 'udanpirapugal' and my 'indrathaai,' my sister-in-law, my lil cousin, my boyfriend, and those mentioned in the post, I guess I have a love-hate relationship with all of them, as I have fought and argued with them at some point, but I have loved and respected them all the most! The universe will always keep surprising you with beautiful people around you.
