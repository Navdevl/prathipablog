## Exploration through Learning: Discoveries on OpenWHO

During a recent browse on LinkedIn, I discovered that the World Health Organization offers various courses through the OpenWHO platform. There was a wide array of public health topics, and I was intrigued by a few, and I'm pleased to share that I've completed the course titled "#PalliativeCare: Models of service delivery and symptom management." Interestingly, I heard a physician refer to it as "comfort care" instead of palliative care, and I found that perspective quite appealing. The term "palliation" can evoke feelings of sadness & pain, whereas the notion of providing comfort carries a more positive and soothing connotation.

## Navigating Career Paths and Evolving Interests

I initially pursued journalism fueled by my passion for writing and a thirst to gain knowledge on current affairs. Volunteering with children during my course made me pursue a master's in social work. I developed an interest in healthcare - in medical and psychiatry, specifically working with children with special needs. Despite completing a certification in working with children with special needs, I didn't pursue it further. I still, at times think of exploring this area once again. In my first job in CSR-related for individuals with disability, I felt disconnected due to limited people connection, prompting my resignation. Now, I work in the field of terminal illnesses and play a role as a transplant coordinator (Bone Marrow Transplant). While the responsibilities are minimal, the experience intrigued me in transplant coordination. This curiosity led me to pursue a course on transplant coordination, not necessarily as a career move, but out of a genuine interest in understanding organ transplants and my potential role in such a scenario. Simultaneously, I'm pursuing a PG diploma in #PublicHealth Journalism, which caught my interest in epidemiology & research, though struggling with basic anatomy. Haha!

## Embracing the Journey of Exploration

Currently working in an environment where palliative care is a common term, I find it intriguing. It provides a sense of purpose, knowing that you can offer comfort to individuals with terminal illnesses until their end-of-care.

Well, I started typing it short this time, but as usual, ended up rambling my whole story. Haha! But hey, who knows? If an idea for a book strikes, I might just quit everything and escape to the hills with my laptop, notebook, and pen. It's okay to explore; not having a niche doesn't mean a lack of passion. Keep learning, keep honing your skills, and never cease to acquire knowledge. Don't confine yourself to just one area; explore different areas. That's a recent lesson I've learned, and have shared it with yâ€™all!

Happy February!
