  September carries deep meaning for me, it is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month
  and also the time we observe World Suicide Prevention Day. Two causes that
  have shaped both my professional journey and my personal resilience.


  In this blog, I reflect on nearly three years in children’s health, close to a
  year in health communication, and the lessons learned along the way - from
  children who remind me why childhood is worth fighting for, to the challenges
  of advocacy, deadlines, leadership and mental health struggles.

# Why Childhood Cancer Awareness?

September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, a field I’ve been working in for the past three years. I’ve been wanting to write for a while now, but life’s whirlwind kept me caught up. Today, on World Suicide Prevention Day, another cause very close to my heart, mental health I decided what better day to finally put these thoughts into words?

So, without beating around the bush, why Childhood Cancer Awareness?
Because childhood matters. Because cancer is curable.

At the core of what we advocate for is 100% access to care. Just a few days ago, I attended a virtual interview where our founder was speaking, and it reminded us of a video, a young girl voicing her frustration at navigating health schemes for her father’s treatment.

Now imagine a parent who has just learned their child has cancer. Devastated. Lost. Not knowing where to go or what to do. That’s why we raise our voice: to make sure no child is left without access and no parent is left in despair.

# Finding My Niche in Children’s Health

I’ve always known I wanted to work for children. I’ve always known the value of health. Over time, I found my niche in children’s health and that’s what drives me.

This month also marks nearly three years in this field and close to a year in health communication. It’s been a rollercoaster. The past few months in my career tested me in ways I can’t even explain.

I told myself I wouldn’t write until things were finalized with a few deadlines at work, but today I just feel grateful, for myself, my team, my support system and the passion that still keeps me going. And I want to shout it out loud.

Let me tell you about a child, Bhagyalakshi, who has Ewing’s sarcoma. Her hands had to be amputated because of cancer. Recently, during an awareness campaign where we asked children to wear our campaign T-shirts for the pan-India launch, she quietly picked out a large one and smiled. That smile, like hers and many that we see here, despite everything they lose is what fuels me. It’s what makes me keep going.

Childhood shouldn’t be lost. Quality of life shouldn’t be compromised. And there are so many children out there like Bhagyalakshmi. That’s why I believe so deeply in this cause, because childhood is precious. And I believe in health as the foundation of everything, both public and mental health. That is why I advocate.and why I continue.

## Timely Diagnosis, Timely Treatment

If there is one message I wish every parent, policymaker and healthcare provider would carry, it’s this...timely diagnosis and timely treatment save lives. With cancer, every day matters. Early detection means not just survival, but better quality of life for children like Bhagyalakshi.

This is why awareness, advocacy and accessible healthcare systems matter so much. Because no family should lose a child to delays and no child should lose their childhood to something treatable.

## The Team That Keeps Me Going

I call myself an empath, but honestly, these past weeks I’ve lost my cool more times than I’d like to admit,  lashed out, walked out. And yet, my team stood by me.

Today, we finally settled something important and I want to give a special shoutout to the newest (and youngest) member of our team, less than a month in, but already handling big tasks with so much grace. I couldn’t be prouder, Aparna. Your mamma bear is happy, just like you all call me :)) I’m just as proud of the whole team, you kiddos keep me going. Happy to do the babysitting, haha!

In this process, you know, there were so many days I desperately wanted to take leave, my body and mind needed it. But with deadlines looming and the need to be with my team to coordinate, I pushed myself to stay. It was exhausting, but we made it through together.

And now, I’m finally looking forward to that break and to concentrate on the wedding ahead soon… my wedding hehe.

## The Tough Septembers & Octobers - Changing the Narrative on Suicide

September through October is always tough. But looking back, I can still feel proud of the person I’ve become. The path I am on right now, may not be my forever path, but I’ve learned so much here. My people skills have grown (though my Hindi is still terrible, haha).

There were so many nights I wanted to reach out to close ones but instead cried myself to sleep out of sheer exhaustion. Times I sought professional help but felt the burden of its cost. It’s a cycle. And yet, even while struggling, I’ve always made space for others to feel seen. And that’s okay.

This year’s theme for World Suicide Prevention Day is “Changing the Narrative on Suicide.”

Suicide is a major public health challenge claiming more than 720,000 lives every year (WHO). This theme calls on us to challenge, reduce stigma and foster open, compassionate conversations. It’s about shifting from silence and misunderstanding toward empathy and support. About creating environments where people feel safe to speak up and seek help, and that is what I have always tried to do with my real talks by sharing my experiences.

## Lessons from Mentors and Bosses

I can hardly believe I’ve grown into someone who has embraced this fields from different paths and dynamics. I’ve learned, unlearned, broken down, rebuilt and I’m still here. And for that, I’m proud.

You know, whenever I got worked up these past few weeks and want to argue about something I feel strongly about, my boss often says just one line: “Pick battles, not wars.” It made a lot of sense and honestly, it’s kept me going.

Back when I had career anxiety, my mentor back in chennai always reminded me that there’s always more to do, more to focus on and to keep moving forward. These past few weeks, whenever I felt like giving up and running away, the words of my boss felt similar to those of my mentor and became a reminder of my bigger purpose, the reason I started.

So I always take a deep breath, have my black coffee, let go and carried on. Exhausting, yes but at least I had a backup: the boss. Thank you sirji :))

And to my team, apologies if you’ve seen my worst side this past week (lol), but we also had a lot of fun along the way. Thank you all.

Thanks Aparna once again. You are little off the loop. Shivam, the next milestone’s on you, no pressure at all, haha.

## Gratitude to My Partner

And in all of this, I cannot forget the one constant who has held me together, my partner.

While balancing the demands of his own career in US Audit, he’s been the only one who truly understands or atleast still tries to understand the nuances of my mental health. He sees my career obsession, my passion, my anxiety and the toll it sometimes takes on my health. He gets far less of the 'fun me' than I wish I could give, yet he never complains.

Instead, he stands by me, grounding me, reminding me I’m not alone in this. Without him, I couldn’t have become this great person who many people appreciate me for. 

So, as I finally look forward to the break I’ve been waiting for, and to our wedding I just want to say... thank you. Thank you for being my strongest supporter, my safe space and for putting up with all of me. 

## Professional and Personal Learnings

This journey has shaped me in ways I never imagined.

* Personally, I’ve learned resilience,  the strength to stand even when I felt like falling apart. I’ve learned the importance of asking for help, even when it feels uncomfortable, and the power of resting before burning out (lol well I have to). Most importantly, I’ve learned that vulnerability is not weakness; it’s the bridge that connects us to others.
* Professionally, I’ve grown into someone who can manage people, lead with empathy, and balance compassion with responsibility. I’ve learned to communicate better, to pick my battles wisely and to celebrate small wins while working toward larger goals.

And as I hope to balance my tasks, I also really want to focus on the Palliative Care Services Programme of our organization, a space where dignity, comfort and compassion stand at the very heart of care. I believe this is where advocacy meets humanity. 

Every child I meet, every caregiver I speak to, every teammate I work with adds a new layer of depth to who I am, both as a person and as a professional.

I’ve learned, unlearned, broken down and rebuilt as I said. But I’m still here. Still fighting for childhoods that deserve to be lived fully. Still speaking openly about mental health in a world that often prefers silence. Still learning to care for myself while caring for others.

That, for me, is the true meaning of this September... to fight for life, theirs, yours and mine.
