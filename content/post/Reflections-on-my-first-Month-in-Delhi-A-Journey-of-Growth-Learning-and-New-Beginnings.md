It’s hard to believe it’s already been a month since I moved to Delhi! Yayy, you can all wish me Month Anniversary! Well, what a whirlwind it’s been, full of challenges, moments of growth, and different learning experiences. Adjusting to a new city, especially one where I don’t speak the local language, has tested me in ways I never imagined. The first few weeks were consumed by the chaos of work and accommodation searches, leaving little room for reflection or homesickness. But by the third week, the weight of loneliness and self-doubt crept in and cried myself to sleep. My routine became a monotonous cycle of work, meals, coffee, sleep, music, and video calls, a comforting but isolating rhythm.

To give myself the space to truly settle in, I decided to put my freelancing projects on hold for now. It’s been a bit of a mixed blessing, on one hand, I’ve had more time to reflect, while on the other, it’s given me plenty of time alone with my thoughts. Although I’m eager to pursue some of my passions in the future, like writing a book or presenting research papers, for now, I’m prioritizing my full-time work and allowing myself to ease into this transition. While I’ve only been in the role for a month and haven’t had much formal orientation, I’ve already been entrusted with important tasks. The trust my superiors and team have shown in me has been motivating. Right now, my focus is on learning, building relationships, and soaking up every experience, this, in itself, has been the most valuable takeaway so far.

# **Finding Balance: A Key Lesson in Self-Care**

One of the biggest adjustments has been finding the right balance between work and self-care. Back in Chennai, I was an early riser who enjoyed morning runs, but in Delhi, I found myself staying up late and waking up past noon on weekends. Realizing this wasn’t sustainable, I decided to change things up and spent today’s break doing something productive for myself. I joined a cycling tour with \*Delhi By Cycle\*, and it was exactly the kind of refreshment I needed! The 15 km ride through Lutyens’ Delhi, even with concerns about the air quality, was invigorating and helped me reconnect with the city. The tour guide, Mr. Utkarsh, shared some incredible insights into community initiatives that are positively impacting Delhi. It was uplifting to be part of something meaningful.

Later in the day, I connected with my BMT kids via video call for their program. Though the call wasn’t perfect, it was a beautiful reminder of home, grounding me and bringing a sense of calm and connection.

# I**nspiration from Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom**

In moments like these, I often think of a quote from Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom: *“There are some mornings when I cry and cry and mourn for myself. Some mornings, I’m so angry and bitter. But it doesn’t last too long. Then I get up and say, I want to live…*” While my struggles aren’t quite the same, this sentiment resonates deeply with me. Not every day is easy, and not every day is productive, but each day brings lessons and opportunities for growth.

# **Gratitude for the Journey and Support**

As I look back on this month, I’m deeply grateful for the kindness and support I’ve received along the way. Special thanks to Stella Ma’am for connecting me with such inspiring and beautiful individuals here in Delhi, and to Lalitha Munoth Ma’am for offering such a warm and peaceful welcome at your place. It’s moments like these that truly make this journey special.

I’m excited for what’s to come! I’m embracing each new experience with an open heart, and I can’t wait to see how this adventure unfolds. Stay tuned for my upcoming reviews of two Mitch Albom books -those will be coming soon!

Looking forward to more lessons, more connections, and continued growth as I embrace the journey ahead!
