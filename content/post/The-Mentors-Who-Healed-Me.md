  Every year, around this time, my anxiety tends to peak. And yet, almost
  instinctively, I turn to writing something hopeful on social media. So here I
  am, doing just that again.


  Yesterday was National Doctors' Day… and apparently, also National Chartered
  Accountants Day. This post might wander a bit, but at its heart, it’s about
  four incredible individuals, three who’ve played deeply personal roles in my
  life, and one I admire from afar. All of them were in my thoughts yesterday.


  This year’s theme for National Doctors' Day was “Behind the Mask: Who Heals

  compassion, often pay a personal price to care for others, right?!

Every year, around this time, my anxiety tends to peak. And yet, almost instinctively, I turn to writing something hopeful on social media. So here I am, doing just that again.

Yesterday was National Doctors' Day… and apparently, also National Chartered Accountants Day. This post might wander a bit, but at its heart, it’s about four incredible individuals, three who’ve played deeply personal roles in my life, and one I admire from afar. All of them were in my thoughts yesterday.

This year’s theme for National Doctors' Day was “Behind the Mask: Who Heals the Healers?”... a reminder that doctors, with all their service and compassion, often pay a personal price to care for others, right?!

## The Mentors Who Healed Me

Let me start with two of the most impactful and beautiful people in my journey, Dr Aruna Rajendran, my primary mentor, and Dr Sasidaran, her husband and my co-mentor, both based in Chennai. They are not just respected professionals in their fields, but also two of the kindest, most compassionate doctors and human beings I’ve ever known.

What makes them exceptional isn’t just their brilliance in medicine. It’s the way they extend their service and mentorship beyond the confines of their specialty, to allied health professionals like me. They invest in people. They generously share their knowledge and nurture those around them. That’s the kind of doctors they are… healers in the truest sense.

It’s been nine months since I left the BMT unit, yet not a single day has gone by without thinking about them..without their words echoing in my mind. That’s the kind of impact they’ve had, both personally and professionally.

Reflecting on this year’s theme, “Who Heals the Healers?”... I found myself thinking about a photo I took last night during a quiet walk. I had sent a small token of love to Dr Aruna last night, something I do with the people I hold dear. That anxious, overwhelmed, but happy face in the picture? That was me.

I know she has been working late. But I didn't realize that long. But later that night, I realized she hadn’t even reached home yet. She was still seeing patients late into the evening… working, serving, healing. Then returning home to her two young boys and her loving family.

It hit me hard. Though I was happy doing my little “ritual,” I was also saddened by how much she juggles. I know she loves her work, but still… Who heals the healers?

And Dr Sasidaran, he initially came across as the “strict professor,” someone I found intimidating. But over time, I saw the warmth behind the formality. I wish I had more time to learn from him. He is a bundle of knowledge yet so humble. Even now, whenever I visit Chennai, I still budge them both. I probably always will.

Just a day before Doctors' Day, I joined a virtual farewell for one of my closest friends.. a brilliant, upcoming clinical researcher from the BMT unit. During the farewell, Dr Aruna said something that hit me deeply: “It’s the allied healthcare workers who’ve kept the unit alive, making it lively now and then.”

Maybe I’m deviating, but this really is what the theme is all about. Who heals the healers? Last night, I did feel guilty, wondering if I disturbed her peace, especially on her special day. But by the end of it, I reminded myself: I celebrated her. From miles away. And I’ll keep celebrating her. Both of them. Always.

They deserve that and so much more.

## The Father of Palliative Care… My Guiding Light From Afar

Next, I want to talk about someone I admire from afar… Dr M R Rajagopalan…the Father of Palliative Care in India… the very field I am now passionately pursuing.

The moment you meet him, all your skepticism about healthcare begins to dissolve. That’s who he is, a living, breathing embodiment of compassion. He doesn’t just practice care; he lives it. And he shares it with the world.

There was a time I kept applying for roles at Pallium India, not because I was desperate for a job, but because I just wanted to be near that kind of energy. I wanted to learn from the foundation he laid and absorb the principles he has spent a lifetime advocating for.

Thank you, Sir, for continuing to inspire me. Your book “Walk with the Weary” still lives within me, and I often pass on its wisdom to others. You’ve sown the seeds of compassionate care…and they continue to bloom in countless lives.

## Not a CA Yet - But Celebrating Him Anywa

Now shifting from doctors to someone closer to home… my partner in all things, my soon-to-be life partner.

He’s a Senior Audit Analyst who flew all the way to Delhi to spend time with me. While he’s not a Chartered Accountant yet, I’m celebrating him this CA Day too.

No, I didn’t wish him formally. But here’s my acknowledgment: The work he does, the depth of his knowledge… it’s genuinely impressive. And to all the aspiring CAs out there who haven’t cracked the final exam yet, you deserve to be celebrated too. Your dedication is no less valuable.

He specializes in US auditing but remains humble enough to help with anything from simple budgeting to complex financial models. I still remember a day when he helped me and a visiting BMT colleague crack a proposal budget in no time, and with no expectations.

Thank you for being an exceptional Audit Analyst. And more importantly, thank you for being an exceptional human being.

## And Then, There’s Me

Yes, my anxiety is peaking… just like it does every year around this time. But I’m also dreaming bigger than ever. Maybe that’s why my posts often come out raw and real, because life isn’t always a bed of roses.

Six months into the year, and honestly? I’ve only read 2.5 books. I’ve played badminton maybe five or six times. Gone on a run or walk around 50 days.

But I’ve also:

* Cooked consistently for the past month
* Managed my work and personal responsibilities
* Excelled at work
* Built deeper connections with my team
* Enrolled in a new course
* Played peacemaker in the family (which counts, right?)

And when I say I’m doing well at work, I mean it, especially in terms of leadership. In Delhi, I’ve had the opportunity to meet powerful leaders, especially women. But the first woman in power who ever inspired me? It was Dr. Aruna. The same woman I’ve spoken about throughout this piece.

I’ve always thrived at the grassroots, a people person. But these encounters, these mentors, and these experiences have stirred something deeper. It’s made me want more.

And now? I believe I can get there.

I still remember my first day at the BMT unit. Dr Aruna barely knew me, but as we waited at the Dean’s office, she said:

“You shouldn’t leave before two years, okay? At most five. But in five years, you should be in a higher administrative position at the WHO or UN, making policy-level changes.”

At the time, I didn’t see myself as a leader. But she did… even before I did.

Even recently, when another opportunity came up within CanKids, she told me:

“There’s no single path for you, Prathipa. Take every chance. Learn everything.”

She believes I can do it.
And now? I believe it too.

It’s not always a bed of roses, and that’s okay.
Maybe I’ll cry.
Maybe I’ll feel overwhelmed.
But I will rise.

I will grow into the woman who belongs at the table, who holds space in the hierarchy, who leads with kindness, and who lives simply.

Because I know now: I can get there.

So yes… six months gone. I’m anxious. I’m overwhelmed. But I’m also inspired. And I’m aiming high.

Thanks to the people I’ve mentioned above, the ones who keep me grounded, who remind me to celebrate myself too… these six months don’t feel lost.

Because in the end, it’s the little things…
The big-hearted people…
And the purpose that keeps us anchored.

One day at a time. One year at a time.
