I've been immersed in non-fiction for quite a while now. However, I felt like changing things up and delving into some light and fun fiction reads for a change. Don't get me wrong, non-fiction still holds a special place in my heart. But there's something enjoyable about dreaming and fantasizing with fiction, isnâ€™t it? So, I decided to switch things up and even changed the language for my last read, haha.

## Tamil Literature Rediscovered

While I've read "Poonachi" and "Goat Thief" by Perumal Murugan in English, I haven't thought about reading Tamil books. "Yanai Doctor" by Mr. Jayamohan is the only Tamil book I've read so far, and I would suggest it to anyone without hesitation. Just thinking about the book brings tears to my eyes. It is such a beautiful book indeed! Ironically, I haven't shown much interest in reading Tamil books, considering my writing journey began with Tamil poetry and publishing small pieces in Tamil journals (I'm happy to share my Tamil works if any of you want to see them, although I consider myself an amateur).

## "Kidai" by K. Rajanarayanan: A Dive into Rural Tamil Nadu

I indulged in another short yet beautiful Tamil novel by Mr. K Rajanarayanan today over a cup of coffee in my portico. The beauty of Tamil novels lies in the meticulous descriptions of characters, from their physical attributes to their personalities. The language used in these novels reflects a particular slang that immerses you in that era. While this immersive experience can also be found in English fiction, as a native Tamil speaker, I find a deeper connection to the Tamil language. I didn't realize how much I had missed reading and writing in Tamil.

"Kidai" by Mr. K. Rajanarayanan is a wonderful book that captures the essence of rural Tamil Nadu through a simple yet profound story about Goats and the lives of Herdsmen. The story seems about goats, but it's much more than that. It looks into the complexities of human relationships, highlighting how the same incident can impact individuals differently based on their gender, caste, and financial status. The book paints a vivid picture of a world with its own rules and beliefs.

Like I said, "Kidai" is not just about goats; it's about life. The author through the book explores themes like love, loss, and ignorance, and also offers a deep look into the human experience in just less than 100 pages.

If you are interested in Tamil literature, with a meaningful story and looking for a light read, I would definitely suggest "Kidai" by Mr K. Rajanarayanan.

Also, I'm open to suggestions for my next Tamil novel to read. Any recommendations?
