## Gratitude and Acknowledgment

Let me begin by expressing gratitude for the person I have evolved into through this job experience.

I’m thankful for the guidance I’ve received every single day throughout this one-year journey, which keeps me motivated to improve. Whether it’s about my personal growth, professional development, or the life lessons I’ve learned, I attribute it to my mentor at the one-year mark. While the changes may not be visibly apparent, if I haven’t given up in life or at work, it’s because of this person. I’ve been inspired by their work, their knowledge, and their passion, pushing me to excel in my own field. Dr. Aruna has been a source of numerous personal and professional insights during this mentorship, and I owe this one-year journey to her. Thank you, Dr. Aruna.

Admiration for another person, whose vision through Cankids granted me the chance to work at the BMT unit of RGGGH. Although not directly mentored by her, her passion and energy fuel the work I do. Thanks to social media, I could witness her passion virtually and stay connected. Thank you, Ms Poonam Bagai.


## Professional Growth and Personal Insights

Empathy & Resilience: This job has profoundly influenced my personal and professional development. Witnessing patients grappling with health issues deepened my empathy, emphasizing the importance of resilience in adversity. The hospital setting has been a significant part of my journey. In recent months, the passing of two patients affected me more than expected, perhaps because I had known them since joining this job. However, what stands out in my thoughts about them is their remarkable resilience and the smiles they maintained until our last encounter. Everyday life in this sector imparts crucial life lessons to me, and I emphasize the importance of taking things one step at a time amidst the overwhelming nature of it all.

Better Communication: While my communication skills are generally adequate, my decline in confidence posed a challenge. Despite my initial hesitations from the first day of this job, to now, engaging with diverse stakeholders and interacting with government officials even for a short conversation, have gradually boosted my confidence. Though still hesitation persists, the numerous opportunities to interact with different stakeholders have played a pivotal role in enhancing both my communication abilities and assertiveness. I’ve found myself standing up for my opinions, even in discussions with my superiors. This, I believe, is an integral part of the learning experience that came with my role. 

Teamwork: In my work, I collaborate with medical professionals, NGOs, donors, and support staff. This teamwork highlights how important it is to work together, creating a feeling of togetherness and a common goal. As someone without a medical background working in a hospital setting, I initially had concerns. However, my colleagues in the unit have been supportive. They respect me for who I am and for the work I do, treating me with care as if I’m one of their own.

Adaptability: Continuous learning in the ever-changing medical field has become a way of thinking that helps me grow personally. My nature of work thus far has involved a new opportunity and a new scope of work every day. Though I have a set of roles and responsibilities as I have mentioned in the post, every day seems to be a new day with new learning and opportunity. Though the uncertainty has created anxiety at times, I guess I am kind of starting to embrace it. 


## Celebrating Small Joys Along the Way

On a random note,

I wanted to share a delightful experience that brought a smile to my face recently. I, sometimes use the elevator from the parking area to reach the fourth floor of my unit. Over the past year, I’ve become familiar with the two lift operators

Recently, one of the operators, upon seeing me, enthusiastically shouted, “Fourth floor, right?” with a self-assured smile. Lol, he remembered me, even through changes in my haircut. The other day, another operator struck up a conversation about my department, and as I exited for the day, he also inquired if my duty for the day was complete.

These small, yet consistent interactions have not only brightened my commute but also served as a reminder of the milestone I’ve reached – completing a full year despite the challenges and temptations to quit. It’s these genuine gestures from the lift operators that added an extra touch of joy to my journey.

And well,

While I still remain uncertain about the specific niche of my career, I would like to take a moment and be content with being able to play a small role in contributing to the greater good. Excited for what the future holds!
