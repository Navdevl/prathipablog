Have you all watched Manjummel Boys? I gave into the hype, despite being off social media for a while and not knowing much about it. But let me tell you, it was worth it! I loved every bit of the thrill and emotions of the movie - <mark>IDHU MANIDHAR UNARNDHU KOLLA MANIDHAR KADHAL ALLA ADHAIYUM THANDI PUNIDHAM AANADHU!<mark>

It's been ages since I made an effort to go out with a friend. But a few days ago, while casually chatting with a friend from work, we randomly booked tickets for Manjummel Boys. I don't know how I agreed to it, as I have been preferring being indoors. But hey, you're all here for my ‘ ADHAIYUM THANDI PUNIDHAM AANADHU’ kind of story of my life, right now!

So, this friend from work, I've known her for a short time. She's like a younger sibling, but our bond has turned us into friends due to the time spent together. I don't regret stepping out after so long because today was truly adventurous! I absolutely loved the movie, but what I cherished even more were the memories it created. You know, I usually don't stop for tea or coffee if there's no place to sit. But my friend insisted we stop at Bilal for the hype of the shop, and I have to say, it was worth it! As we were heading back home, I started having menstrual cramps, but we were laughing and chatting, so it didn't bother me much. Suddenly, my bike started shaking, and I thought it was just my old vehicle acting up. Turns out, it was actually punctured in the middle of a main road! Without any hesitation, my friend took charge and started pushing the vehicle.

Like I always believe in the love and kindness of the universe, thankfully, two kind strangers stopped by and helped us to a nearby puncture shop. Since my bike was shaking too much for me to drive, my friend took the lead once again. She confidently took the bike to the shop, got it fixed, and drove back to pick me up, all without any hesitation. My heart was racing until she returned even though she was closer, but seeing her drive back filled me with happiness and gratitude.

It may not be a big incident like in the movie, but to me, being an anxious person, and was almost in cramp pains, it was indeed huge. Despite every odds, my friend didn't hesitate to help, even though she had to travel back home alone. Most of the time, apart from your immediate family, it's the friends who become like family that are the best kind of relationships. You never know who will become that kind of person to you. People can always surprise you. I'm grateful to have you around, Sorna! Thanks for today! It was truly a good day!

<i>Coming back to the movie, it is sad that this movie was based on a real-life incident. What are your thoughts on the movie, and how do you feel about friends who become like family?</i>
